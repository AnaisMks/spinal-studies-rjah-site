My research interests lie in the study, both in the laboratory and the clinic, of factors that affect the function of the knee over the lifetime of a patient.

In the laboratory I am investigating the effect of subchondral bone health on the health of the articular cartilage in the knee. This involves the isolation and characterisation of various primary cell types from the subchondral bone and cartilage of tissue donated following total knee replacement. Subsequently, the characterised populations are employed in a co-culture model to investigate the effect of subchondral bone cells from regions of the joint with and without pathological changes (visible macroscopically and using imaging modalities) on the extracellular matrix forming capabilities of the patient-matched chondrocytes.

Clinically, I am interested in the relationship between activity levels and knee function, and the part played by psychosocial factors in this relationship. We have carried out an initial analysis of activity, knee function and psychosocial data that was previously collected as part of an on-going cell therapy clinical trial. It was discovered that the relationship between activity levels and knee function varies between individuals, with some patients demonstrating a positive relationship, and others a negative one. Moreover, we found that some of this patient-to-patient variation can be explained by the patientâ€™s positive and negative outlook scores. We are now in the process of applying for ethical approval to carry out a more robust study of these factors using wearable technology to provide an objective measure of activity levels.
