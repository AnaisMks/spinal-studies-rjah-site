The Rheumatology Research lab is based at the [RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/), Oswestry as part of the ISTM Regenerative Medicine theme. The combined clinical and research excellence in Oswestry has contributed extensively to the current knowledge of mechanisms and therapy treatments for arthritis.


## Research: {#research}

The research within our laboratory is focused on understanding **mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis progression and possible treatments** including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium and mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles. We also try to find out how stem cells can be “encouraged” to perform better in aging and in disease such as arthritis. In our research we use many approaches, from cell biology, to biochemistry, molecular biology and animal models.


## Current active projects {#current-active-projects}

1.  **Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles as therapeutic agents in arthritis**

    MSCs function predominantly through paracrine mechanisms, via growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and bioactive, membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) found in mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium. We are pursuing simultaneous characterisation of EVs derived from human MSCs cultured in different conditions to determine the impact of culture conditions upon the molecular composition of EVs. We are using pre-clinical and clinical samples to test the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of EVs.

2.  **Uncovering the role of heparan sulphate proteoglycans in extracellular vesicle biogenesis: potential tools for improved therapies**

    In collaboration with Dr Cathy Merry, Nottingham University we propose that EVs may be optimised for regenerative medicine therapies by controlling the cargo incorporated and efficiency of EV production, through manipulating EV biogenesis mechanisms. One such mechanism involves a family of proteoglycans called syndecans. Here we aim to develop a method of exosome optimisation through specific alterations to the syndecan structures on MSC surfaces.

3.  **The in vitro effect of syndecan-3 gene knockout on bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells’ properties**

    Inflammation is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis that affects around 1% of the population and can result in disability and morbidity. The immunomodulatory effects of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells has been widely studied and the recent observations that syndecan-3 (SDC3) is selectively pro-inflammatory in the joint led us to hypothesise that SDC3 might play an important role in MSCs biology. Syndecans are heparan sulphate proteoglycans expressed by endothelial cells of blood vessels and play a role in trafficking of inflammatory cells in an arthritis model.
