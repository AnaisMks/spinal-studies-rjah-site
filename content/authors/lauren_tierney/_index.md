I am a PhD student working at both Keele University and [The Robert hunt and Agnes Jones Orthopaedic hospital in Oswestry](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/).

PhD project: Transcriptome analysis of stem cell and chondrocyte therapies.

I commenced work on this project in January 2019. During the course of this research project I will be investigating the transcriptome profiles (generated via RNA sequencing technologies) of the cells used in the autologous stem cell, chondrocyte or the two (ASCOT) clinical trial. From there, differential gene expression analysis will be performed in order to identify whether there is an association between gene expression profiles and trial outcome measures, and if so, examine the possible biological pathways involved.

Prior to starting this PhD, I obtained a BSc in Biomedical Science from Keele University and was employed at a Genetic Toxicology contract research organisation during and after finishing my degree. Previous to that, I completed a modern apprenticeship at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals working within Genetic Toxicology, Hepatic Toxicology and Cardiac Toxicology departments.
