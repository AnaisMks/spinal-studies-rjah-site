I am based at the [Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital](https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/) in Oswestry and currently employed as a Consenting Research Officer.
With this role I am the main interface between Keele Researchers (based at the RJAH), hospital clinicians and clinic staff, and importantly the patients attending pre-operative clinics at the hospital.

I studied for my PhD at the RJAH and have subsequently worked there for many years as a post-doctoral researcher.Â  I have a keen interest in bone health and disease and the preservation of cartilage, with previous experience in the development and application of novel markers of bone resorption and clinical research studies investigating skeletal health in the ageing population
