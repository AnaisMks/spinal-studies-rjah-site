I am a Research Associate based at the [[https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/][Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital]].
I am currently funded on a [[https://mrc.ukri.org/][Medical Research Council]] Industry Collaboration Grant (MICA) which aims to assess the potential of human chondrocytes from juvenile donor sources for the use in cell therapy approaches aimed at treating cartilage damage/early-OA.
These sources include chondrocytes from extra digits surgically removed for the treatment of polydactyly, along with tissue from the iliac apophysis collected from consented patients being treated for hip dysplasia and from young adult amputee donors.
This work aims to determine whether these chondrocytes are suitable for large-scale GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) expansion in the [[https://www.terumobct.com/quantum][Quantum^{TM} bioreactor]].

I am also very active in optimising currently offered surgical procedures for early-OA, by identifying biomarkers to predict patient outcome to these surgeries (previously funded by a [[https://www.versusarthritis.org/][Versus Arthritis]] grant).
Much of my work utilises skillsets I developed during my PhD studies, at The [[https://www.manchester.ac.uk/][University of Manchester]], by performing proteomics (and other large scale ‘omic approaches) to identify completely novel biomarkers.
This includes identifying candidate biomarkers for prediction of outcome following Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation, osteotomy and microfracture.
I first came joined the OsKOR group in 2015, where I to worked on a project (funded by the [[https://www.orthopaedic-institute.org/][Orthopaedic Institute]]) to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the outcome neurology of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).
I continue to be interested in projects relating to SCI, currently co-supervising a third year PhD student.
I also supervise a first year PhD student who is looking at better understanding the science behind how bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) procedures work and also on stratifying patients for this treatment in the ankle (funded by the [[https://www.orthopaedic-institute.org/][Orthopaedic Institute]]).

My research interests revolve around the biology & pathology of musculoskeletal disorders.
I began my career at the RJAH in 2006 as a Research Assistant prior to embarking on my PhD studies in the Charles Salt Centre for Metabolic Research investigating the role of osteoprotegerin in osteoblastic cells.
Since completing my studies in 2010, I have been employed by Keele University as a Research Associate, based in the Centre for Spinal Studies and Cartilage Research group at the RJAH. I am also a visiting lecturer for University Centre Shrewsbury.

I was initially funded on a Versus Arthritis programme grant with Prof Sally Roberts, investigating cell therapy treatments such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for osteoarthritis and played a large part in the development of the current clinical trial ASCOT (Autologous Stem Cells, Chondrocytes or the Two?).
A secondary outcome measure of the trial, part funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), is the assessment of the quality of the repair tissue formed following cell therapy, of which I am jointly responsible for alongside Prof Roberts; this also involves studying the production and expression of extracellular matrix components and associated cellular signalling pathways.
I am also involved in the analysis of a sister population of the cells being returned to the patients, with the aim of trying to identify markers that have the potential to help identify a therapeutically potent sub-population of cells for treating patients in the future.

I am currently funded on an MRC grant with Dr Jan-Herman Kuiper, focusing on the spontaneous/natural healing of articular cartilage (SHARC) of patients having undergone surgery that involved a controlled cartilage injury (such as a harvest biopsy for ACI).
This will be based on the histochemical and biochemical analyses of repair tissue biopsies, synovial fluid biomarkers, medical imaging and gait analysis.
I also supervise a first year PhD student, investigating the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) to treat cartilage defects in the ankle.

I was awarded a MD in Clinical Medicine from Dalian Medical University in 2016.
I got an PhD offer from Keele University in Cell and Tissue Engineering in 2017.
Since then I started my research work as a PhD student at the RJAH and currently in my final year of PhD.

My research interests are meniscus injuries, focusing on:​
- Understanding meniscus degeneration​
- Enhancing meniscus tissue repair​
- Developing cell-based meniscus therapies

Beyond the lab work, I am also a big basketball fan.
One of the reason I looked into meniscus repair is I injured my own meniscus twice while playing basketball.
Now I am trying to cure myself!​

I am based at the [[https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/][Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital]] in Oswestry.  I work on a grant funded by [[https://www.versusarthritis.org/][Versus Arthritis]] as part of the [[http://arthritistissueengineering.org.uk][Tissue Engineering Centre]]. The focus of my research has been to isolate and characterise Mesenchymal stromal cells from human umbilical cords as an allogeneic source of cells for regenerative cell therapies for the treatment of diseases such as Osteoarthritis (OA).  We have used these cells in two pre-clinical models of OA and grown them successfully in the [[https://www.terumobct.com/quantum][Quantum® bioreactor]] for large-scale cell expansion.

I also work on the ASCOT (Autologous Stem Cells Chondrocytes Or the Two) clinical trial as part of a team that analyses the cells being returned to patients.  One of the aims of this work is to try to find markers which may help us identify the most therapeutically potent cells for treating patients in the future.

The Rheumatology Research lab is based at the [[https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/][RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital]], Oswestry as part of the ISTM Regenerative Medicine theme. The combined clinical and research excellence in Oswestry has contributed extensively to the current knowledge of mechanisms and therapy treatments for arthritis.

*** Research:
The research within our laboratory is focused on understanding *mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis progression and possible treatments* including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium and mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles. We also try to find out how stem cells can be “encouraged” to perform better in aging and in disease such as arthritis. In our research we use many approaches, from cell biology, to biochemistry, molecular biology and animal models. 
*** Current active projects
    1. *Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles as therapeutic agents in arthritis*

       MSCs function predominantly through paracrine mechanisms, via growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and bioactive, membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) found in mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium. We are pursuing simultaneous characterisation of EVs derived from human MSCs cultured in different conditions to determine the impact of culture conditions upon the molecular composition of EVs. We are using pre-clinical and clinical samples to test the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of EVs.

    2. *Uncovering the role of heparan sulphate proteoglycans in extracellular vesicle biogenesis: potential tools for improved therapies*

       In collaboration with Dr Cathy Merry, Nottingham University we propose that EVs may be optimised for regenerative medicine therapies by controlling the cargo incorporated and efficiency of EV production, through manipulating EV biogenesis mechanisms. One such mechanism involves a family of proteoglycans called syndecans. Here we aim to develop a method of exosome optimisation through specific alterations to the syndecan structures on MSC surfaces.

    3. *The in vitro effect of syndecan-3 gene knockout on bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells’ properties*

       Inflammation is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis that affects around 1% of the population and can result in disability and morbidity. The immunomodulatory effects of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells has been widely studied and the recent observations that syndecan-3 (SDC3) is selectively pro-inflammatory in the joint led us to hypothesise that SDC3 might play an important role in MSCs biology. Syndecans are heparan sulphate proteoglycans expressed by endothelial cells of blood vessels and play a role in trafficking of inflammatory cells in an arthritis model.

My research interests lie in the study, both in the laboratory and the clinic, of factors that affect the function of the knee over the lifetime of a patient.

In the laboratory I am investigating the effect of subchondral bone health on the health of the articular cartilage in the knee. This involves the isolation and characterisation of various primary cell types from the subchondral bone and cartilage of tissue donated following total knee replacement. Subsequently, the characterised populations are employed in a co-culture model to investigate the effect of subchondral bone cells from regions of the joint with and without pathological changes (visible macroscopically and using imaging modalities) on the extracellular matrix forming capabilities of the patient-matched chondrocytes.

Clinically, I am interested in the relationship between activity levels and knee function, and the part played by psychosocial factors in this relationship. We have carried out an initial analysis of activity, knee function and psychosocial data that was previously collected as part of an on-going cell therapy clinical trial. It was discovered that the relationship between activity levels and knee function varies between individuals, with some patients demonstrating a positive relationship, and others a negative one. Moreover, we found that some of this patient-to-patient variation can be explained by the patient’s positive and negative outlook scores. We are now in the process of applying for ethical approval to carry out a more robust study of these factors using wearable technology to provide an objective measure of activity levels.

My research is based at the [[https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/][Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry]] and focused on understanding the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of Osteoarthritis (OA).
This work is in an attempt to harness specific features of the immune system to help drive tissue regeneration in damaged human articular joints.

Special attention is given to macrophages due to their ability to switch between multiple phenotypes, one of which helps promote an anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative microenvironment.
My other research interests include understanding the natural healing of articular cartilage and the large-scale production of cells for allogenic cartilage cell therapies.

I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Rheumatology Research department based at RJAH, Oswestry. My research centres around umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), with a particular focus on their anti-inflammatory properties. This work will comprise of three main research objectives: 
1.	The isolation and characterisation of UC-MSC EVs, to allow comparison between donors, to determine if MSC variability is reflected in their EV population, possibly contributing to minimal criteria for their clinical application.
2.	Development towards an allogeneic strategy of EV production by pooling UC-MSC donors, to explore their cellular properties and detect potential immunogenic responses.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Sheffield after completing a BSc in Biomedical Science. Following this, I was accepted on to a DTC programme in Regenerative Medicine, allowing me to undertake research projects such as ‘the generation of a polymer brush of different lengths and densities to characterise the behaviour of SYSY-5Y cells’ and ‘the characterisation of collagen VI from osteoarthritic-sourced cartilage and the effect of its addition on chondrocytes’, which ultimately led me to my PhD project being undertaken today.

I am a PhD student working at both Keele University and [[https://www.rjah.nhs.uk/][The Robert hunt and Agnes Jones Orthopaedic hospital in Oswestry]].

PhD project: Transcriptome analysis of stem cell and chondrocyte therapies.

I commenced work on this project in January 2019. During the course of this research project I will be investigating the transcriptome profiles (generated via RNA sequencing technologies) of the cells used in the autologous stem cell, chondrocyte or the two (ASCOT) clinical trial. From there, differential gene expression analysis will be performed in order to identify whether there is an association between gene expression profiles and trial outcome measures, and if so, examine the possible biological pathways involved.

Prior to starting this PhD, I obtained a BSc in Biomedical Science from Keele University and was employed at a Genetic Toxicology contract research organisation during and after finishing my degree. Previous to that, I completed a modern apprenticeship at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals working within Genetic Toxicology, Hepatic Toxicology and Cardiac Toxicology departments.

This is a brief introduction to formatting in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] made mostly to help my dear colleagues with writing content for the site

*** Why org-mode?
This website uses a single [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file to manage most of the content.
Org-mode is an example of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language][markup language]], which means the text formating is described in the text itself.
This is in contrast to a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG][what you see is what you get]]" system where the formatting information is hidden from the user and stored in the file data somehow, as Microsoft Word does with it's proprietary file formats.

There are several advantages to using plain text.
Perhaps the most important of which is transportability and reproducibility.
You can't view or edit a .doc file without special software (which you often have to pay for), whereas plain text files can be viewed an edited on any computer, regardless of operating system, and with thousands of text editors to choose from.

The only real disadvantage to markup languages is that you have to learn their syntax.
This is only really an issue for some languages though, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=Hypertext%20Markup%20Language%20(HTML)%20is,scripting%20languages%20such%20as%20JavaScript.][html]] (the language website are written in) is fairly complicated and fiddly, but languages like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#:~:text=Markdown%20is%20a%20lightweight%20markup,Markdown][markdown]] and org-mode were made to be simple and easy to learn.
And this post is going to demonstrate the basics, so read on!

Plus, with a bit of magic from [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] you can convert pretty much any markup language to any other markup language.
This lets us do things like export a markdown file to a really nice pdf, or html document!


**** A note on working with org-mode files
Org-mode is made to be used with the wonderful [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], which sells itself as an extensible text editor, but it's really just an elisp interpreter geared towards text editing.
Emacs makes working with org-mode files a joy, though it has a bit of a learning curve itself.
There are plenty of great [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/][guides]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8&list=PL9KxKa8NpFxIcNQa9js7dQQIHc81b0-Xg][videos]] for getting to grips with emacs, but you can of course use whatever plain text editor you like!

*** Formatting
For example, if you would like *bold text*, you simply wrap the text with * like so: =*bold*=
similarly, we can have

#+CAPTION: If you're wondering how I'm able to show the formatting without it rendering have a look at this .org file on the [[https://github.com/H-Mateus/spinal-studies-rjah-site/blob/master/content-org/all-posts.org][git repository]] 
| Rendered text    | Raw text           |
|------------------+--------------------|
| /italics/        | =/italics/=        |
| =monospace=      | ==monospace==      |
| ~code~           | =~code~=           |
| +strike-through+ | =+strike-through+= |
| _underlined_     | =_underlined_=     |

If you want a footnote [fn:: org-mode sure is neat!] use =[fn:: footnote text goes here]=.
It even comes with a helpful return link!

*** Headings and lists
For headings org-mode uses *:
- =* Level one header=
- =** Level two header=
- =*** Level three header=

and so on. Org-mode will automatically scale the text to the size of the level of the header.

For bullet point lists use =-= or =+= or numbers =1.=
The following:
- using =-=
=- item 1= \\
=- item 2=
- using =+=
=+ item 1= \\
=+ item 2=
- using numbers
=1. numbered list 1= \\
=2. numbered list 2=

Renders to:
1. using =-=
   + item 1
   + item 2

2. using =+=
   + item 1
   + item 2
3. using numbers
   a. numbered list 1
   b. numbered list 2

*** Links and images
To insert [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink][links]] use square brackets like so: =[[link_address_goes_here][text_goes_here]]=
The link in the previous sentence looks like this:
=[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink][links]]=

To insert images we do the same, but the link has to point to an image in the static/images directory of the site
So =[[/images/red_panda.jpg]]=
Results in the following image being embedded

#+CAPTION: I know the feeling panda...
[[/images/red_panda.jpg]]

And if you're wondering about the captions, just add header on the line above whatever you want caption:

=#+CAPTION: caption text goes here= \\
=thing you want a caption on goes here(normally an image or table)=

*** Symbols and equations
For things like Greek letters just type the letter after a \ like so:
| \alpha   | =\alpha= |
| \beta   | =\beta=  |
| \gamma   | =\gamma= |
| \pm | =\pm=    |
| \ge   | =\ge=      |
| \neq   | =\neq=      |

For more complex equations we can use [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics][latex math]] syntax and wrap in single =$= for inline equations, and double =$$= for equation blocks.
So =$a=+\sqrt{2}$= renders to $a=+\sqrt{2}$.

And =$$P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}>4\right)$$= renders to

$$P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}>4\right)$$

We can also wrap in =\(= and close with =\)= for inline and =\[= =\]= for blocks to produce the same effect

*** Code and foldable blocks 
So there's this awesome package called [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] that let you include code from pretty much any widely used language in org-mode files.
I won't go into depth on org-babel here as there's a lot to it, but I'll use it to demonstrate folding blocks (click on the line bellow with the triangle to expand or collapse the block)

#+begin_details

#+begin_summary
A little R code
#+end_summary

#+begin_src R
## notice we get nice code highlighting to boot
head(mtcars)

for(i in 1:3){
print("code")}
#+end_src

#+end_details

So there are three parts here:

=#+begin_details= \\
=#+begin_summary= \\
=A little R code= \\
=#+end_summary= \\
=#+begin_src= \\
=## notice we get nice code highlighting to boot= \\
=head(mtcars)= \\
=for(i in 1:3){= \\
=print("code")}= \\
=#+end_src= \\
=#+end_details= \\

The whole thing is wrapped in the =begin_details= block, the text next the triangle is defined in the =begin_summary=, and the code is in the =begin_src= block.
Note that each block must be closed, and that code doesn't have to be run, the output with be produced during export

abstract = "Neurological outcomes following spinal cord injury (SCI) are currently difficult to predict. Whilst the initial American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) grade can give an estimate of outcome, the high remaining degree of uncertainty has stoked recent interest in biomarkers for SCI. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of routinely measured blood biomarkers by developing prognostic models of AIS scores at discharge and 12-months post-injury. Routine blood and clinical data were collected from SCI patients (n=427) and blood measures that had been assessed in less than 50% of patients were excluded. Outcome neurology was obtained from AIS and Spinal cord independence measure III (SCIM-III) scores at discharge and 12-months post-injury, with motor (AIS) and sensory (AIS, touch and prick) abilities being assessed individually. Linear regression models with and without elastic net penalisation were created for all outcome measures. Blood measures associated with liver function such as alanine transaminase were found to add value to predictions of SCIM-III at discharge and 12-months post-injury. Furthermore, components of a total blood count including haemoglobin were found to add value to predictions of AIS motor and sensory scores at discharge and 12-month post-injury. These findings corroborate the results of our previous preliminary study and thus provide further evidence that routine blood measures can add prognostic value in SCI, and that markers of liver function are of particular interest."

abstract = "There is increasing interest in the identification of biomarkers that could predict neurological outcome following a spinal cord injury (SCI). Although initial American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) grade is a good indicator of neurological outcome, for the patient and clinicians, an element of uncertainty remains. This preliminary study aimed to assess the additive potential of routine blood analytes following Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to develop prognostic models for neurological outcome following spinal cord injury. Routine blood and clinical data were collected from SCI patients (n=82) and PCA used to reduce the number of blood analytes into related factors. Outcome neurology was obtained from AIS scores at 3- and 12-months post-injury, with Motor (AIS and Total including all myotomes) and Sensory (AIS, Touch and Pain) being assessed individually. Multiple regression models were created for all outcome measures. Blood analytes relating to 'liver function' and 'acute inflammation and liver function' factors were found to significantly increase prediction of neurological outcome at both 3 months (Touch, Pain and AIS Sensory) and at 1 year (Pain, R^2 increased by 0.025 and Total Motor, R^2 increased by 0.016). For some models 'liver function' and 'acute inflammation and liver function' factors were both significantly predictive with the greatest combined R^2 improvement of 0.043 occurring for 3m Pain prediction.  These preliminary findings support ongoing research into the use of routine blood analytes in the prediction of neurological outcome in SCI patients."

Here, we report two first-in-man cases (patient A and B) treated with combined autologous chondrocyte and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell implantation (CACAMI), with 8-year follow up. Two patients with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III–IV cartilage lesions underwent a co-implantation of autologous chondrocytes and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) between February 2008 and October 2009. In brief, chondrocytes and BM-MSCs were separately isolated and culture-expanded in a good manufacturing practice laboratory for a period of 2–4 weeks. Cells were then implanted in combination into cartilage defects and patients were clinically evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, using the self-reported Lysholm knee score and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Postoperative Lysholm scores were compared with the Oswestry risk of knee arthroplasty (ORKA) scores. Patient A also had a second-look arthroscopy, at which time a biopsy of the repair site was taken. Both patients demonstrated a significant longterm improvement in knee function, with postoperative Lysholm scores being consistently higher than ORKA predictions. The most recent Lysholm scores, 8 years after surgery were 100/100 (Patient A) and 88/100 (Patient B), where 100 represents a fully functioning knee joint. Bone marrow lesion (BML) volume was shown to decrease on postoperative MRIs in both patients. Cartilage defect area increased in patient A, but declined initially for patient B, slightly increasing again 2 years after treatment. The repair site biopsy taken from patient A at 14 months postoperatively, demonstrated a thin layer of fibrocartilage covering the treated defect site. The use of a combination of cultured autologous chondrocytes and BM-MSCs appears to confer long-term benefit in this two-patient case study. Improvements in knee function perhaps relate to the observed reduction in the size of the BML."

abstract = "Articular cartilage is composed of chondrons within a territorial matrix surrounded by a highly organized extracellular matrix comprising collagen II fibrils, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and non-collagenous proteins. Damaged articular cartilage has a limited potential for healing and untreated defects often progress to osteoarthritis. High hopes have been pinned on regenerative medicine strategies to meet the challenge of preventing progress to late osteoarthritis. One such strategy, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), was first reported in 1994 as a treatment for deep focal articular cartilage defects. ACI has since evolved to become a worldwide well-established surgical technique. For ACI, chondrocytes are harvested from the lesser weight bearing edge of the joint by arthroscopy, their numbers expanded in monolayer culture for at least four weeks, and then re-implanted in the damaged region under a natural or synthetic membrane via an open joint procedure. We consider the evolution of ACI to become an established cell therapy, its current limitations, and on-going strategies to improve its efficacy. The most promising developments involving cells and natural or synthetic biomaterials will be highlighted."

abstract = "Meniscus degeneration is closely related to the progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, there is currently a lack of quantitative and objective metrics to assess OA meniscal cell phenotypes. In this study we investigated the phenotypic markers and chondrogenic potency of avascular and vascular meniscal cells and chondrocytes from medial OA knee joints (n = 10). Flow cytometry results showed that a significantly greater percentage of meniscal cells were positive for CD49b, CD49c and CD166 compared to donor-matched chondrocytes after 14 days in monolayer culture. The integrins, CD49b and CD29, were expressed at a significantly higher level on avascular meniscal cells derived from tissues with a more degenerated inner border than non-degenerate menisci, suggesting that the integrin family may play an important role in meniscus OA pathology. Collagen fibres arranged in a “tree-like” formation within the meniscus appeared to have less blood vessels associated with them in the vascular region of the most degenerate menisci, which may indicate that such structures are involved in the pathological process. We have demonstrated that meniscal cells derived from the lateral meniscus in medial OA patients have chondrogenic capacity in vitro and hence could represent a potential cell source to consider for meniscus tissue engineering."
