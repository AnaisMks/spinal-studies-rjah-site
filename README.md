# Readme

This is the github repo of the [OsKOR group website](https://oskor.netlify.app/).

## Initial setup

### Cloning the homepage repo

- Make a github account [here](https://github.com/).
- Ask Mateus ([g.m.bernardo.harrington@keele.ac.uk](mailto:g.m.bernardo.harrington@keele.ac.uk)) to be added as a collaborator to the repo.
- Open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you'd like to clone the repository.
- Run this command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/H-Mateus/spinal-studies-rjah-site.git
```

### Install Hugo

This site uses the [Hugo static website generator](https://gohugo.io/), so you will need to install it.

- On Linux Hugo is available in most major repositories so you can install from there.
- On Mac you'll likely want to use `homebrew`, instructions for which can be found [here](https://brew.sh/).
- On Windows you'll want to stop making bad life choices. If you refuse, there is a docker container or you could use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), instructions [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
